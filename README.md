### Git Tutorial
- Create a local git repository
When creating a new project on your local machine using git, you’ll first create a new repository.
To begin, check the default working directory using the pwd command. Move to where you want to place the project on your local machine using the cd command. 
- Initialization
To initialize a git repository in the root of the folder, run the git init command.
```
git init
```
- Registration
- Add a new file to the repository
Go ahead and add a new file to the project using any text editor you like or just running a touch command.
However, you could always copy and paste folders or files directly to your git working directory.
- Create a commit
```
git commit -m “logging” c
```
- Create a new repository on GitHub & Push a branch to GitHub

- Push your commit to Github

```
git remote add origin https://github.com/elifaydin1033/homework
```
```
git push -u origin master
```
